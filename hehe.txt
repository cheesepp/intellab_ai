1. Lesson: Primality Test | Set 1 (Introduction and School Method)
   • Introduction to the concept of primality testing and different methods for determining if a number is prime or composite
   • Explanation of the school method, also known as trial division, which checks divisibility up to the square root of the number
   • Discussion on the efficiency of the school method and its limitations in terms of computational complexity

2. Lesson: Primality Test | Set 2 (Fermat Method)
   • Introduction to Fermat's primality test, a probabilistic algorithm for determining if a number is probably prime or composite
   • Explanation of the basis of the test, which relies on Fermat's Little Theorem and Wilson's theorem
   • Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using the Fermat method compared to other primality testing methods

3. Lesson: Primality Test | Set 3 (Miller-Rabin)
   • Introduction to the Miller-Rabin primality test, a probabilistic algorithm for determining if a number is probably prime or composite
   • Explanation of the basis of the test, which relies on repeated squaring modulo the number and checking for non-trivial factors
   • Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using the Miller-Rabin method compared to other primality testing methods, including its ability to handle large numbers more efficiently than Fermat's method

4. Lesson: Primality Test | Set 4 (Solovay-Strassen)
   • Introduction to the Solovay-Strassen primality test, a deterministic algorithm for determining if a number is prime or composite
   • Explanation of the basis of the test, which relies on the Chinese Remainder Theorem and repeated squaring modulo powers of 2 and 3
   • Discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using the Solovay-Strassen method compared to other primality testing methods, including its ability to handle large numbers more efficiently than Fermat's method while still being deterministic
