We perform all the operations through\\nthe current pointer only.  \\n****Auxiliary Space:**** O(N), where N is the size of the stack\\n\\n\\nIn this implementation, we define a Node class that represents a node\\nin the linked list, and a Stack class that uses this node class to\\nimplement the stack. The head attribute of the Stack class points to the\\ntop of the stack (i.e., the first node in the linked list).\\n\\nTo push an item onto the stack, we create a new node with the given\\nitem and set its next pointer to the current head of the stack. We then\\nset the head of the stack to the new node, effectively making it the new\\ntop of the stack.\\n\\nTo pop an item from the stack, we simply remove the first node from the\\nlinked list by setting the head of the stack to the next node in the\\nlist (i.e., the node pointed to by the next pointer of the current\\nhead). We return the data stored in the original head node, which is the\\nitem that was removed from the top of the stack.\\n\\n### Benefits of implementing a stack using a singly linked list include:\\n\\n****Dynamic memory allocation****: The size of the stack can be increased or decreased dynamically by\\nadding or removing nodes from the linked list, without the need to\\nallocate a fixed amount of memory for the stack upfront.\\n\\n****Efficient memory usage:**** Since nodes in a singly linked list only have a next pointer and not a\\nprev pointer, they use less memory than nodes in a doubly linked\\nlist.\\n\\n****Easy implementation****: Implementing a stack using a singly linked list is straightforward\\nand can be done using just a few lines of code.\\n\\n****Versatile****: Singly linked lists can be used to implement other data structures\\nsuch as queues, linked lists, and trees.\\n\\nIn summary, implementing a stack using a singly linked list is a simple\\nand efficient way to create a dynamic stack data structure in\\nPython.\\n\\n### Real time examples of stack:\\n\\nStacks are used in various real-world scenarios where a last-in,\\nfirst-out (LIFO) data structure is required. Here are some examples of\\nreal-time applications of stacks:\\n\\n****Function call stack****: When a function is called in a program, the return address and all\\nthe function parameters are pushed onto the function call stack. The\\nstack allows the function to execute and return to the caller function\\nin the reverse order in which they were called.\\n\\n****Undo/Redo operations:****\\nIn many applications, such as text editors, image editors, or web\\nbrowsers, the undo and redo functionalities are implemented using a\\nstack. Every time an action is performed, it is pushed onto the stack.\\nWhen the user wants to undo the last action, the top element of the\\nstack is popped and the action is reversed.\\n\\n****Browser history:**** Web browsers use stacks to keep track of the pages visited by the user.\\nEvery time a new page is visited, its URL is pushed onto the stack. When\\nthe user clicks the “Back” button, the last visited URL is popped from\\nthe stack and the user is directed to the previous page.\\n\\n****Expression evaluation****: Stacks are used in compilers and interpreters to evaluate\\nexpressions. When an expression is parsed, it is converted into postfix\\nnotation and pushed onto a stack. The postfix expression is then\\nevaluated using the stack.\\n\\n****Call stack in recursion:****\\nWhen a recursive function is called, its call is pushed onto the stack.\\nThe function executes and calls itself, and each subsequent call is\\npushed onto the stack. When the recursion ends, the stack is popped, and\\nthe program returns to the previous function call.\\n\\nIn summary, stacks are widely used in many applications where LIFO\\nfunctionality is required, such as function calls, undo/redo operations,\\nbrowser history, expression evaluation, and recursive function\\ncalls.\\n'),\n",

We can only insert the element at the back and remove the\\n   element from the front of the queue.\\n2. [****Double-Ended Queue (Deque)****](\\n   In a double-ended queue the insertion and deletion operations, both\\n   can be performed from both ends. They are of two types:\\n   * ****Input Restricted Queue:**** This is a simple queue. In this type of queue, the input can be\\n     taken from only one end but deletion can be done from any of the\\n     ends.\\n   * ****Output Restricted Queue:****\\n     This is also a simple queue. In this type of queue, the input can\\n     be taken from both ends but deletion can be done from only one\\n     end.\\n3. [****Circular Queue:****]( This is a special type of queue where the last position is connected\\n   back to the first position. Here also the operations are performed in\\n   FIFO order.\\n4. [****Priority Queue****](\\n   A priority queue is a special queue where the elements are accessed\\n   based on the priority assigned to them. They are of two types:\\n   * ****Ascending Priority Queue:**** In Ascending Priority Queue, the elements are arranged in\\n     increasing order of their priority values. Element with smallest\\n     priority value is popped first.\\n   * ****Descending Priority Queue:**** In Descending Priority Queue, the elements are arranged in\\n     decreasing order of their priority values. Element with largest\\n     priority is popped first.\\n\\n![Types-of-Queue](\\n\\n****Applications of Queue Data Structure****\\n\\nApplication of queue is common. In a computer system, there may be\\nqueues of tasks waiting for the printer, for access to disk storage, or\\neven in a time-sharing system, for use of the CPU. Within a single\\nprogram, there may be multiple requests to be kept in a queue, or one\\ntask may create other tasks, which must be done in turn by keeping them\\nin a queue.\\n\\n* A Queue is always used as a buffer when we have a speed mismatch\\n  between a producer and consumer. For example keyboard and CPU.\\n* Queue can be used where we have a single resource and multiple\\n  consumers like a single CPU and multiple processes.\\n* In a network, a queue is used in devices such as a router/switch and\\n  mail queue.\\n* Queue can be used in various algorithm techniques like Breadth First\\n  Search, Topological Sort, etc.'), Document(id='44fbe689-87c8-4eab-a5e2-6afcc4d31bc9', metadata={'course_name': 'Queue', 'lesson_name': 'Introduction to Queue Data Structure'}, page_content='Course Name: Queue\\nLesson Name: Introduction to Queue Data Structure\\n\\nContent:\\nBasic Terminologies of Queue\\n\\n* ****Front:**** Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the\\n  first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the ****front**** of the queue.

When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include\\n   [CPU scheduling](\\n   [Disk Scheduling](\\n2. When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received\\n   at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO\\n   Buffers,\\n   [pipes]( file IO, etc.\\n3. Linear Queue: A linear queue is a type of queue where data elements are\\n   added to the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.\\n   Linear queues are used in applications where data elements need to be\\n   processed in the order in which they are received. Examples include\\n   printer queues and message queues.\\n4. Circular Queue: A circular queue is similar to a linear queue, but the\\n   end of the queue is connected to the front of the queue. This allows for\\n   efficient use of space in memory and can improve performance. Circular\\n   queues are used in applications where the data elements need to be\\n   processed in a circular fashion. Examples include CPU scheduling and\\n   memory management.\\n5. Priority Queue: A priority queue is a type of queue where each element\\n   is assigned a priority level. Elements with higher priority levels are\\n   processed before elements with lower priority levels. Priority queues\\n   are used in applications where certain tasks or data elements need to be\\n   processed with higher priority. Examples include operating system task\\n   scheduling and network packet scheduling.\\n6. Double-ended Queue: A double-ended queue, also known as a deque, is a\\n   type of queue where elements can be added or removed from either end of\\n   the queue. This allows for more flexibility in data processing and can\\n   be used in applications where elements need to be processed in multiple\\n   directions. Examples include job scheduling and searching algorithms.\\n7. Concurrent Queue: A concurrent queue is a type of queue that is designed\\n   to handle multiple threads accessing the queue simultaneously.\\n   Concurrent queues are used in multi-threaded applications where data\\n   needs to be shared between threads in a thread-safe manner. Examples\\n   include database transactions and web server requests.\\n\\n**Issues of Queue :**\\n\\nSome common issues that can arise when using queues:\\n\\n1. Queue overflow: Queue overflow occurs when the queue reaches its maximum\\n   capacity and is unable to accept any more elements. This can cause data\\n   loss and can lead to application crashes.\\n2. Queue underflow: Queue underflow occurs when an attempt is made to\\n   remove an element from an empty queue. This can cause errors and\\n   application crashes.\\n3. Priority inversion: Priority inversion occurs in priority queues when a\\n   low-priority task holds a resource that a high-priority task needs. This\\n   can cause delays in processing and can impact system performance.\\n4. Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when multiple threads or processes are\\n   waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a situation\\n   where none of the threads can proceed. This can happen when using\\n   concurrent queues and can lead to system crashes.\\n5. Performance issues: Queue performance can be impacted by various\\n   factors, such as the size of the queue, the frequency of access, and the\\n   type of operations performed on the queue. Poor queue performance can\\n   lead to slower system performance and reduced user experience.\\n6. Synchronization issues: Synchronization issues can arise when multiple\\n   threads are accessing the same queue simultaneously. This can result in\\n   data corruption, race conditions, and other errors.\\n7. Memory management issues: Queues can use up significant amounts of\\n   memory, especially when processing large data sets. Memory leaks and\\n   other memory management issues can occur, leading to system crashes and\\n   other errors.\\n\\n**Reference :**\\n\\nSome references for further reading on queues:\\n\\n1. “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java” by Robert Lafore – This book\\n   provides an in-depth explanation of different types of queues and their\\n   implementations in Java.\\n2. “Introduction to Algorithms” by Thomas H.

So, while inserting the elements, the insertion\\n   will be in the same sequence but while deleting, the order will be 8, 4,\\n   2.\\n\\nThe time complexity of the Priority Queue is O(logn).\\n\\n[**Applications of a Queue:**](\\n\\nThe\\n[queue](\\nis used when things don’t have to be processed immediately, but have to be\\nprocessed in First In First Out order like\\n[Breadth First Search]( This property of Queue makes it also useful in the following kind of\\nscenarios.\\n\\n1. When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include\\n   [CPU scheduling](\\n   [Disk Scheduling](\\n2. When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received\\n   at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO\\n   Buffers,\\n   [pipes]( file IO, etc.\\n3. Linear Queue: A linear queue is a type of queue where data elements are\\n   added to the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.\\n   Linear queues are used in applications where data elements need to be\\n   processed in the order in which they are received. Examples include\\n   printer queues and message queues.\\n4. Circular Queue: A circular queue is similar to a linear queue, but the\\n   end of the queue is connected to the front of the queue. This allows for\\n   efficient use of space in memory and can improve performance. Circular\\n   queues are used in applications where the data elements need to be\\n   processed in a circular fashion. Examples include CPU scheduling and\\n   memory management.\\n5. Priority Queue: A priority queue is a type of queue where each element\\n   is assigned a priority level. Elements with higher priority levels are\\n   processed before elements with lower priority levels. Priority queues\\n   are used in applications where certain tasks or data elements need to be\\n   processed with higher priority. Examples include operating system task\\n   scheduling and network packet scheduling.\\n6. Double-ended Queue: A double-ended queue, also known as a deque, is a\\n   type of queue where elements can be added or removed from either end of\\n   the queue. This allows for more flexibility in data processing and can\\n   be used in applications where elements need to be processed in multiple\\n   directions. Examples include job scheduling and searching algorithms.\\n7. Concurrent Queue: A concurrent queue is a type of queue that is designed\\n   to handle multiple threads accessing the queue simultaneously.\\n   Concurrent queues are used in multi-threaded applications where data\\n   needs to be shared between threads in a thread-safe manner. Examples\\n   include database transactions and web server requests.\\n\\n**Issues of Queue :**\\n\\nSome common issues that can arise when using queues:\\n\\n1. Queue overflow: Queue overflow occurs when the queue reaches its maximum\\n   capacity and is unable to accept any more elements. This can cause data\\n   loss and can lead to application crashes.\\n2. Queue underflow: Queue underflow occurs when an attempt is made to\\n   remove an element from an empty queue. This can cause errors and\\n   application crashes.\\n3. Priority inversion: Priority inversion occurs in priority queues when a\\n   low-priority task holds a resource that a high-priority task needs. This\\n   can cause delays in processing and can impact system performance.\\n4. Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when multiple threads or processes are\\n   waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a situation\\n   where none of the threads can proceed. This can happen when using\\n   concurrent queues and can lead to system crashes.\\n5. Performance issues: Queue performance can be impacted by various\\n   factors, such as the size of the queue, the frequency of access, and the\\n   type of operations performed on the queue. Poor queue performance can\\n   lead to slower system performance and reduced user experience.\\n6. Synchronization issues: Synchronization issues can arise when multiple\\n   threads are accessing the same queue simultaneously. This can result in\\n   data corruption, race conditions, and other errors.\\n7. Memory management issues: Queues can use up significant amounts of\\n   memory, especially when processing large data sets. Memory leaks and\\n   other memory management issues can occur, leading to system crashes and\\n   other errors.\\n\\n**Reference :**\\n\\nSome references for further reading on queues:\\n\\n1. “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java” by Robert Lafore – This book\\n   provides an in-depth explanation of different types of queues and their\\n   implementations in Java.\\n2. “Introduction to Algorithms” by Thomas H.

–** Removal of elements from the queue.\\n* **peek() or front()-** Acquires the data element available\\n  at the front node of the queue without deleting it.\\n* **rear() –** This operation returns the element at the rear\\n  end without removing it.\\n* **isFull() –** Validates if the queue is full.\\n* **isEmpty() –** Checks if the queue is empty.\\n* **size():** This operation returns the size of the queue\\n  i.e. the total number of elements it contains.\\n\\n![](\\n\\nQueue Data Structure\\n\\n### **Operation 1: enqueue()**\\n\\nInserts an element at the end of the queue i.e. at the

Data Structure are:\\n\\n* **enqueue() –** Insertion of elements to the queue.\\n* **dequeue() –** Removal of elements from the queue.\\n* **peek() or front()-** Acquires the data element available\\n  at the front node of the queue without deleting it.\\n* **rear() –** This operation returns the element at the rear\\n  end without removing it.\\n* **isFull() –** Validates if the queue is full.\\n* **isEmpty() –** Checks if the queue is empty.\\n* **size():** This operation returns the size of the queue\\n  i.e. the total number of elements it contains.\\n\\n![](\\n\\nQueue Data Structure\\n\\n### **Operation 1: enqueue()**\\n\\nInserts an element at the end of the queue i.e. at the rear end.\\n\\nThe following steps should be taken to enqueue (insert) data into a queue:\\n\\n* Check if the queue is full.\\n* If the queue is full, return overflow error and exit.\\n* If the queue is not full, increment the rear pointer to point to the\\n  next empty space.\\n* Add the data element to the queue location, where the rear is pointing.\\n* return success.\\n\\n![Enqueue representation](\\n\\nEnqueue representation\\n\\nBelow is the Implementation of the above

This queue is\\nprimarily used in the following cases:\\n\\n1. **Memory Management:** The unused memory locations in the\\n   case of ordinary queues can be utilized in circular queues.\\n2. **Traffic system:** In a computer-controlled traffic\\n   system, circular queues are used to switch on the traffic lights one by\\n   one repeatedly as per the time set.\\n3. **CPU Scheduling:** Operating systems often maintain a\\n   queue of processes that are ready to execute or that are waiting for a\\n   particular event to occur.\\n\\nThe time complexity for the circular Queue is O(1).\\n\\n**2. Input restricted Queue:** In this type of Queue, the\\ninput can be taken from one side only(rear) and deletion of elements can\\nbe done from both sides(front and rear). This kind of Queue does not\\nfollow FIFO(first in first out).  This queue is used in cases where\\nthe consumption of the data needs to be in FIFO order but if there is a\\nneed to remove the recently inserted data for some reason and one such\\ncase can be irrelevant data, performance issue, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n![Input Restricted Queue](\\n\\nInput Restricted Queue\\n\\n**Advantages of Input restricted Queue:**\\n\\n* Prevents overflow and overloading of the queue by limiting the number of\\n  items added\\n* Helps maintain stability and predictable performance of the system\\n\\n**Disadvantages of Input restricted Queue:**\\n\\n* May lead to resource wastage if the restriction is set too low and items\\n  are frequently discarded\\n* May lead to waiting or blocking if the restriction is set too high and\\n  the queue is full, preventing new items from being added.\\n\\n**3. Output restricted Queue:** In this type of Queue, the\\ninput can be taken from both sides(rear and front) and the deletion of the\\nelement can be done from only one side(front).

There are two types of Priority Queues. They are:\\n\\n1. **Ascending Priority Queue:** Element can be inserted\\n   arbitrarily but only smallest element can be removed. For example,\\n   suppose there is an array having elements 4, 2, 8 in the same order. So,\\n   while inserting the elements, the insertion will be in the same sequence\\n   but while deleting, the order will be 2, 4, 8.\\n2. **Descending priority Queue:** Element can be inserted\\n   arbitrarily but only the largest element can be removed first from the\\n   given Queue. For example, suppose there is an array having elements 4,\\n   2, 8 in the same order. So, while inserting the elements, the insertion\\n   will be in the same sequence but while deleting, the order will be 8, 4,\\n   2.\\n\\nThe time complexity of the Priority Queue is O(logn).\\n\\n[**Applications of a Queue:**](\\n\\nThe\\n[queue](\\nis used when things don’t have to be processed immediately, but have to be\\nprocessed in First In First Out order like\\n[Breadth First Search]( This property of Queue makes it also useful in the following kind of\\nscenarios.\\n\\n1. When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include\\n   [CPU scheduling](\\n   [Disk Scheduling](\\n2. When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received\\n   at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO\\n   Buffers,\\n   [pipes]( file IO, etc.\\n3. Linear Queue: A linear queue is a type of queue where data elements are\\n   added to the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.\\n   Linear queues are used in applications where data elements need to be\\n   processed in the order in which they are received. Examples include\\n   printer queues and message queues.\\n4. Circular Queue: A circular queue is similar to a linear queue, but the\\n   end of the queue is connected to the front of the queue. This allows for\\n   efficient use of space in memory and can improve performance. Circular\\n   queues are used in applications where the data elements need to be\\n   processed in a circular fashion. Examples include CPU scheduling and\\n   memory management.\\n5. Priority Queue: A priority queue is a type of queue where each element\\n   is assigned a priority level. Elements with higher priority levels are\\n   processed before elements with lower priority levels. Priority queues\\n   are used in applications where certain tasks or data elements need to be\\n   processed with higher priority. Examples include operating system task\\n   scheduling and network packet scheduling.\\n6. Double-ended Queue: A double-ended queue, also known as a deque, is a\\n   type of queue where elements can be added or removed from either end of\\n   the queue. This allows for more flexibility in data processing and can\\n   be used in applications where elements need to be processed in multiple\\n   directions. Examples include job scheduling and searching algorithms.\\n7. Concurrent Queue: A concurrent queue is a type of queue that is designed\\n   to handle multiple threads accessing the queue simultaneously.\\n   Concurrent queues are used in multi-threaded applications where data\\n   needs to be shared between threads in a thread-safe manner. Examples\\n   include database transactions and web server requests.\\n\\n**Issues of Queue :**\\n\\nSome common issues that can arise when using queues:\\n\\n1. Queue overflow: Queue overflow occurs when the queue reaches its maximum\\n   capacity and is unable to accept any more elements. This can cause data\\n   loss and can lead to application crashes.\\n2. Queue underflow: Queue underflow occurs when an attempt is made to\\n   remove an element from an empty queue. This can cause errors and\\n   application crashes.\\n3. Priority inversion: Priority inversion occurs in priority queues when a\\n   low-priority task holds a resource that a high-priority task needs. This\\n   can cause delays in processing and can impact system performance.\\n4. Deadlocks: Deadlocks occur when multiple threads or processes are\\n   waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a situation\\n   where none of the threads can proceed. This can happen when using\\n   concurrent queues and can lead to system crashes.\\n5. Performance issues: Queue performance can be impacted by various\\n   factors, such as the size of the queue, the frequency of access, and the\\n   type of operations performed on the queue. Poor queue performance can\\n   lead to slower system performance and reduced user experience.\\n6. Synchronization issues: Synchronization issues can arise when multiple\\n   threads are accessing the same queue simultaneously. This can result in\\n   data corruption, race conditions, and other errors.\\n7. Memory management issues: Queues can use up significant amounts of\\n   memory, especially when processing large data sets.

    "Lesson: Applications, Advantages and Disadvantages of Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Enqueue and Dequeue Operations**: These are primary queue operations that allow elements to be inserted at the rear end (enqueue) and removed from the front end (dequeue), respectively. Both operations have a time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "• **Types of Queues**: There are four types of queues: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, and Deque. Each has its own characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "• **Implementation of Queue**: A queue can be implemented using either an array (sequential allocation) or a linked list (linked list allocation), with the latter allowing for unlimited elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "• **Primary Queue Operations**: The primary queue operations include enqueue (inserting an element at the rear end) and dequeue (removing an element from the front end), both of which have a time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "• **Types of Queues**: There are three main types of queues: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, and Priority Queue. Each has its own characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "• **Advantages and Disadvantages of Queue**: The advantages of using a queue include efficient management of large amounts of data, fast insertion and deletion operations, and suitability for multi-threading and shared resource allocation. However, the disadvantages include time-consuming middle element insertion and deletion, limited search capabilities, and fixed maximum size in array implementations.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Lesson**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Different Types of Queues**: A queue is an abstract data type that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, where elements are added to the end of the queue and removed from the front. There are several types of queues, including:\n",
    "\t+ Linear Queue: A linear queue is a basic queue implementation where elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory.\n",
    "\t+ Circular Queue: A circular queue is similar to a linear queue but the end of the queue is connected to the front of the queue, allowing for efficient use of space in memory.\n",
    "\t+ Priority Queue: A priority queue is a type of queue where each element has a priority level. Elements with higher priority levels are processed before elements with lower priority levels.\n",
    "\t+ Double-Ended Queue (Deque): A double-ended queue is a type of queue where elements can be added or removed from either end of the queue.\n",
    "* **Applications of Queues**: Queues have various applications in computer science and programming, including:\n",
    "\t+ CPU Scheduling: Queues are used to schedule tasks for execution by the CPU.\n",
    "\t+ Memory Management: Queues are used to manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\t+ Network Packet Scheduling: Queues are used to schedule network packets for transmission over a network.\n",
    "* **Issues of Queue**: Some common issues that can arise when using queues include:\n",

    "• **Queue Implementation**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, where elements are added to the end and removed from the front. This concept is crucial for understanding how queues work and how they can be implemented using various data structures.\n",
    "• **Basic Operations**: The lesson covers three basic operations that can be performed on a queue: Enqueue, Dequeue, and Peek. These operations allow users to add elements to the queue (Enqueue), remove elements from the front of the queue (Dequeue), and retrieve the element at the front without removing it (Peek).\n",
    "• **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity for these basic operations is O(1) in the best case, where the operation is performed on an empty queue. In the worst-case scenario, when the queue is full, the Enqueue operation becomes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.\n",
