The `query` method iterates through the current nodes of the Trie and updates the root based on the new letter added to the stream. It then checks if any node ends with a word (`#`) and returns true if so.","tool_calls":[],"tool_call_id":null,"run_id":"9c2ed074-2c0e-480d-9283-059e5f895784","metadata":{"model":"codeqwen","created_at":"2025-03-10T01:18:23.061904Z","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":27616512417,"load_duration":542849208,"prompt_eval_count":1071,"prompt_eval_duration":7406000000,"eval_count":561,"eval_duration":19561000000,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","images":null,"tool_calls":null}},"custom_data":{},"thread_id":"102"}

{"type":"ai","content":"1. PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING\n   - **Clarify the problem statement if needed**: Make sure the user understands that the function `StreamChecker(String[] words)` initializes an object that checks for suffixes in a stream of characters against a list of strings. The method `query(char letter)` accepts a new character from the stream and returns true if any non-empty suffix forms a word that is in `words`.\n   - **Identify what the user specifically needs help with**: Determine whether the user requires guidance on how to implement the `StreamChecker` class, understanding its data structures, or debugging their own implementation.\n\n2. COACHING APPROACH\n   - For beginners: Focus on core concepts and provide more structured guidance\n     * **Conceptual**: Explain basic algorithms and data structures such as prefix trees (tries) and a stream processing approach to check suffixes in the stream of characters.\n     * **STRATEGIC**: Discuss how to use tries to store and search for words efficiently.\n   - for intermediate/advanced: Engage in higher-level discussions about optimization and design choices\n     * **Conceptual**: Incorporate more advanced topics like suffix automata and suffix trees.\n     * **STRATEGIC**: Discuss how to optimize the tries to improve search performance by using compressed paths or a combination of tries and other data structures.\n   - When user asks directly: Provide relevant insights without unnecessary structure\n\n3. FLEXIBLE GUIDANCE OPTIONS\n   - **CONCEPTUAL**: Explain data structures and algorithms relevant to the problem\n     * Prefix trees (tries): How they work, their advantages in search operations, and their complexity analysis.\n   - **STRATEGIC**: Provide a high-level approach without exact implementation\n     * Using prefix trees to efficiently check for suffixes in the stream of characters.\n   - **DEBUGGING**: Help identify issues in existing solution attempts\n     * Common errors related to initialization, implementation details, and data structure usage.\n   - **OPTIMIZATION**: Discuss complexity improvements and performance considerations\n     * Exploring different approaches to store words for efficient searching.\n   - **LEARNING**: Suggest related problems and resources for deeper understanding\n\n4. INTERACTIVE LEARNING\n   - Encourage the user to share their current thinking\n     * Ask targeted questions to promote self-discovery\n     * Offer feedback on how they're approaching the problem\n   - Adapt subsequent guidance based on user responses\n     * Respond promptly and confidently, acknowledging each question\n\nRemember: Your goal is to empower the user to discover solutions through guided learning while being responsive to their specific questions and needs. Be conversational rather than rigid in your coaching approach.","tool_calls":[],"tool_call_id":null,"run_id":"c74a2f10-8e68-4936-b2ca-636dc8d38462","metadata":{"model":"codeqwen","created_at":"2025-03-10T01:29:44.280611Z","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":27707824458,"load_duration":538599000,"prompt_eval_count":1071,"prompt_eval_duration":5126000000,"eval_count":619,"eval_duration":21932000000,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","images":null,"tool_calls":null}},"custom_data":{},"thread_id":"102"}
{"type":"ai","content":"Based on the given problem statement, we can use a data structure called an array of tries to solve this problem efficiently. Here's how we can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = [None] * 26\n        self.is_end_of_word = False\n\nclass StreamChecker:\n    def __init__(self, words):\n        # Create a root node for the tries\n        self.root = TrieNode()\n        for word in words:\n            node = self.root\n            for char in reversed(word):\n                if node.children[ord(char) - ord('a')] is None:\n                    node.children[ord(char) - ord('A')] = TrieNode()\n                node = node.children[ord(char) - ord('A')]\n            # Mark the last node as an end of word\n            node.is_end_of_word = True\n\n        self.prefix = deque([])\n\n    def query(self, letter):\n        self.prefix.appendleft(letter)\n        node = self.root\n        for char in self.prefix:\n            if node.children[ord(char) - ord('A')] is None:\n                return False\n            node = node.children[ord(char) - ord('A')]\n            # If we find a word at any point, return True\n            if node.is_end_of_word:\n                return True\n        return False\n```\n\nThis solution maintains a deque `prefix` to store the characters in the stream in reverse order, and then checks if there's an end of word node for each character. If we find an end of word node, it means the suffix formed by that point is present in the words list, so we return True. If not found, we keep checking the rest of the characters. The time complexity for this solution is O(N), where N is the total length of all words combined, as each character is visited exactly once. This makes it an efficient approach for solving the problem.","tool_calls":[],"tool_call_id":null,"run_id":"bccbf6cc-4ecb-464e-bf80-eb4a47609e09","metadata":{"model":"codeqwen","created_at":"2025-03-10T01:31:15.613923Z","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":18143150875,"load_duration":10134875,"prompt_eval_count":1064,"prompt_eval_duration":1737000000,"eval_count":472,"eval_duration":16390000000,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","images":null,"tool_calls":null}},"custom_data":{},"thread_id":"102"}
