{"type":"ai","content":"List of strategies which can solve this problem:\n\n1. Analyze the input string - Break down the string into individual characters and map them to the pattern of zigzag rows.\n2. Understand how the zig-zag pattern works - Each row will have elements arranged in a specific order (Z, P, A...). For example, in the 3rd row \"PAYPALISHIRING\", it has P, A and Y alternatively.\n3. Identify edge cases - If the input string is empty or the number of rows is less than or equal to 1, return the original string.\n4. Implement the algorithm - Iterate through each character in the zigzag pattern and build up the result string. You can use a two-dimensional array for tracking the characters in their corresponding row indices.\n5. Test the solution with various test cases - Use different input strings to verify that your function produces the expected output.","tool_calls":[],"tool_call_id":null,"run_id":"adf4cf8e-4adb-4306-8434-cd9e9783dfe7","metadata":{"model":"codeqwen","created_at":"2025-03-10T01:45:28.076289Z","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":9256617916,"load_duration":12304291,"prompt_eval_count":682,"prompt_eval_duration":2638000000,"eval_count":203,"eval_duration":6603000000,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"","images":null,"tool_calls":null}},"custom_data":{},"thread_id":"12a0a7ef-70aa-45ed-9542-871ae4fe315e"}
