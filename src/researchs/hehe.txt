  4. Course ID: 95713603-63d1-4b75-8a89-1acdc0977459
     Description: The Stack lesson series offers a comprehensive introduction to one of the fundamental data structures in programming. You'll explore how a Stack operates based on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, perform core operations such as push, pop, and peek, and apply these concepts to real-world problems like validating parentheses, converting expressions, or building a browser's backtracking system. This series is ideal for beginners and those looking to strengthen their understanding of data structures.
